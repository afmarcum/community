### Motivation

Open source software is an essential part of modern software development, and
of practically all technology solutions. Adoption of open source software has
grown over the past two decades, powering everything from tiny "Internet of
Things" devices to the most advanced supercomputers in the world. This has led
to enormous productivity gains, allowing software engineers to focus more on
solving business problems and less on creating and re-creating the same
building blocks needed in many situations.

With these benefits, however, comes some risk. Attackers frequently target
open source projects and the ecosystems they are a part of in order to 
compromise the organizations or users that use those projects. It's
essential that we understand these threats and work to build defenses against
them.

This is a top level group.
