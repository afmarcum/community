# Identifying Security Threats in Open Source Projects

The purpose of this working group is to enable stakeholders to have informed
confidence in the security of open source projects. We do this by collecting,
curating, and communicating relevant metrics and metadata from open source
projects and the ecosystems of which they are a part.

### Objective

Our objective is to enable stakeholders to have informed confidence in the
security of open source projects. This includes identifying threats to the
open source ecosystem and recommending practical mitigations. We will also
identify a set of key metrics and build tooling to communicate those metrics
to stakeholders, enabling a better understanding of the security posture of
individual open source software components.

### Scope

The scope of this working group includes "security", as opposed to privacy,
resiliency, or other related areas. We also consider the broad open source
ecosystem, as opposed to focusing exclusively on critical open source projects.
