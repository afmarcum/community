## Process

For more detailed infomration please reach our [charter](https://openssf.org/about/charter/).

Currently, the OpenSSF Governing Board meets the first Thursday of every month, at 8am PT, for 90 minutes. These meetings are closed to the public. 

A deck with the agenda and slides appears at least 48 hours ahead of time, along with attachments. 

Each board member is expected to spend at least 30 minutes to review the agenda, slides, and attachments to be prepared for the conversation.

There are a number of other sub-bommittees open to observation by GB members, or even appointment to as a voting committee member:

1) The Governance Committee, which meets once every 3 weeks
2) The Budget & Finance Committee, which meets once a quarter
3) The Marketing Committee, though often a product marketing or developer relations-focused delegate is appointed to represent the organization
4) The Public Policy Committee, which meets every 2 weeks, to focus on our engagement with the public sector

All of the sub-bommittees are optional, but we believe also very useful to enhancing the value a member receives from their OpenSSF membership.
