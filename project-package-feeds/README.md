# FeedOptions

## FeedOptions

Feeds can be configured with additional options, not all feeds will support these features. Check [feeds/README.md](./pkg/feeds/README.md) for more information on feed specific configurations.

Below is an example of such options with pypi being configured to poll a specific set of packages

```
feeds:
- type: pypi
  options:
    packages:
    - fooPackage
    - barPackage
```
