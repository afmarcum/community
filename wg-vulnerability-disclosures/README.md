## **Objective**

The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping develop and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication. We plan on addressing this challenge through the following actions:

- Documenting and promoting reasonable vulnerability disclosure and coordination practices within the OSS ecosystem for component maintainers and community members by providing documented standards and educational materials.

- Identifying vulnerability disclosure pain points for OSS maintainer, consumers, and security researchers and take steps to address them.

- Facilitate the development and adoption of a standards-based OSS Vulnerability Exchange that uses existing industry formats and allows OSS projects of all sizes to be able to report, share, and learn about vulnerabilities within OSS components.

This is a top level group.
