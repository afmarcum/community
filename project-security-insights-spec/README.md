# Introduction

## Introduction

Security is important, for this reason, many potential users (final users, engineers, 
developers, or companies) might want to evaluate the security of a particular 
open-source project. There are many ways to evaluate the security of a project, 
including evaluating the code itself (statically or dynamically), the processes used, 
and/or the people involved (e.g., whether or not they know how to develop secure 
software).

Some information can be determined automatically by tools, but determining 
information via tools is often imperfect. For example, many would want to know if a 
project uses an automated test suite, yet because there are so many different kinds 
of test suites & ways to invoke them, automated tools often fail to correctly 
identify whether or not automated tests are performed. It can be provided manually, 
but that must be done for each approach.

This specification provides a mechanism for projects to report information about 
their security in a machine-processable way. It is formatted as a YAML file to make 
it easy to read and edit directly by people. It is expected that a first draft of the 
file would be created by automated tools, "wizards" that guide users through the 
answers, and linter tools that help users to check the YAML file schema. The file is 
then put under version control, provided to potential users, and updated as needed. 
The file's contents may then be extracted for a variety of different reasons (e.g., 
extracted into security evaluations, etc.).

This is an early version created by the OpenSSF Identifying Security Threats Working 
Group. See the [OpenSSF Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
