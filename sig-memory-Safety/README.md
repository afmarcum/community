## **Motivation**

Memory safety vulnerabilities, caused by mistakes in memory management, are common in unsafe programming languages like C and C++.This type of vulnerability is responsible for a majority of security breaches, with estimates from Microsoft and Google showing that up to 70% and 90% of vulnerabilities in their products, respectively, are memory safety vulnerabilities.

Memory safe languages like Rust, Go, and Java are less prone to these types of errors. The consequences of these vulnerabilities are not just technical, but can result in significant financial losses and invasion of personal data and privacy. A recent analysis by Google Project Zero showed that 67% of vulnerabilities exploited in the wild were due to a lack of memory safety, making it a critical issue that needs to be addressed in software development.

This is under the Best Practices working group.
