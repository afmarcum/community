## Process

The de facto public policy subcommittee process is that someone reports on something that the committee needs to know.

- If the goal is awareness the process is done.
- If the goal is to *respond* then that person suggests that the group develop a response. 
  - If the group generally agrees, then work begins. 
  - The owner/delegator of the work is to assigned someone.
