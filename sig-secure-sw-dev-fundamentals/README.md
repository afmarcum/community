# How do I get an MFA token?

## How do I get an MFA token?

If your open source software (OSS) project has been notified that
you're getting a free token from us,
you'll receive a Google coupon code or a GitHub validation code.
Here are step-by-step instructions:

* [How to get a Titan token from Google](getting-titan-token-from-google.md)
* [How to get a Yubikey token from GitHub](getting-yubikey-token-from-github.md)

If you contribute to an OSS project and were not contacted during our first round of
token distribution, please reach out to our [Working Group](mailto:openssf-wg-best-practices+owner@lists.openssf.org) for more information.

Currently the tokens are shipped from the US. They are shipped
internationally but that is subject to various limitations. See the
[invitation.md](./invitation.md) for more information.

The OpenSSF cares about privacy and does *not* get detailed lists of
who gets every token; we only get aggregate values (per-project Google tokens
and aggregate totals from GitHub).

This is under the Best Practices working group.
