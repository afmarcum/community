# WG Securing Critical Projects

This charter describes operations as an [OSSF Technical Initiative](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/master/charters/).
The [Focus](#focus) section below describes what is in and out of scope,
and [Governance](#governance) section describes how our operations are consistent with OSSF policies with links to more detailed documents.

Open Source Software has long suffered from a "tragedy of the commons" problem.
Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many projects are struggling for the time, resources and attention they need.

This is a resource allocation problem - and we can help solve it together.
We need ways to connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that can provide them with support.

Whether it is dedicated help from specialized experts or simply grant money or cloud credits, we recognize that no two
projects are the same, and support can come in many shapes.
We intend to work with upstream maintainers to understand what help and support they need, and then develop scalable processes to make
this help available.

### Objective

To the best of our efforts, the goals of the working group are:

1. Identify critical open source software (OSS) projects. 
2. Secure those projects.

## Current Work

* [Securing Critical Projects: List of Critical Open Source Projects, Components, and Frameworks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONZ4qeMq8xmeCHX03lIgIYE4MEXVfVL6oj05lbuXTDM/edit) - current version
    * Leads: Amir Montazery and Julia Ferraioli
    * Contributors: David Wheeler, Caleb Brown, Michael Scovetta, Georg Kunz
* [criticality_score](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score) - this attempts to estimate criticality using the algorithm described in ["Quantifying Criticality" by Rob Pike](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/blob/main/Quantifying_criticality_algorithm.pdf); you can see the [Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25381397). A known challenge is that it emphasizes activity, and some critical projects aren't active.

## Antitrust Policy Notice

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy>. If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.
