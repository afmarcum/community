# OSSF Security Tooling

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions related to the group's mission and charter.

## Motivation

## Motivation

Most developers are not security experts and even the most seasoned developers, security experts or not, make mistakes.  Tools can be used to help weed out security defects allowing developers to focus on the features they want to develop.

## Objective

## Objective

Our mission is to Identify, Evaluate, Improve, Develop & Ease Deployment of universally-accessible, developer focused tooling to help the open source community secure their code.  This space allows members to collaborate together on these goals.

* Identify - There are a large number of tools that developers can utilize in various development environments.  We need to ensure we understand the options available.
* Evaluate - Some tools are better than others.  We need to ensure quality tools are available to the open source community.
* Improve - Some tools need just a little bit of help to offer the best solution.  We need to, where possible, contribute to improve those tools.
* Develop - Despite the large number of tools available, there are still large areas of the security problem space that do not have tools to help developers find issues.  We will develop those tools where there is interest and bandwidth.
* Ease Deployment - __Most critically__, open source developers need to know what tools they should be using and how to easily integrate them into their development process.  Unless developers have an easy way to drop in security tooling, it is unlikely to be included.  We will provide this information to open source developers.

## Antitrust Policy

## Antitrust policy

Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy>. If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.
