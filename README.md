## Motivation







Most developers are not security experts and even the most seasoned developers, security experts or not, make mistakes.  Tools can be used to help weed out security defects allowing developers to focus on the features they want to develop.



Supply chain issues and attacks cause significant damage worldwide including lost revenue, costs of ransomware payments, costs of mitigation, denial of access to resources, reduced customer trust, and public deception. As a matter of public trust, governments are beginning to mandate actions aimed at improving the security and integrity of supply chains. The [US White House Executive Order on Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) is one such example.

Open Source Software has long suffered from a "tragedy of the commons" problem.
Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many projects are struggling for the time, resources and attention they need.

This is a resource allocation problem - and we can help solve it together.
We need ways to connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that can provide them with support.

Whether it is dedicated help from specialized experts or simply grant money or cloud credits, we recognize that no two
projects are the same, and support can come in many shapes.
We intend to work with upstream maintainers to understand what help and support they need, and then develop scalable processes to make
this help available.



Open source software is an essential part of modern software development, and
of practically all technology solutions. Adoption of open source software has
grown over the past two decades, powering everything from tiny "Internet of
Things" devices to the most advanced supercomputers in the world. This has led
to enormous productivity gains, allowing software engineers to focus more on
solving business problems and less on creating and re-creating the same
building blocks needed in many situations.

With these benefits, however, comes some risk. Attackers frequently target
open source projects and the ecosystems they are a part of in order to 
compromise the organizations or users that use those projects. It's
essential that we understand these threats and work to build defenses against
them.



This working group is for and focuses on the maintainers of software repositories, software registries, and tools which rely on them, at various levels including system, language, plugin, extensions and container systems. It provides a forum to share experiences and to discuss shared problems, risks and threats.

## Objective



The End User Working Group aims to ensure that the distinct and impactful voice of end users is heard in the development and delivery of the technical vision of OpenSSF.



Our objective is to provide open source developers with best practices recommendations, and with an easy way to learn and apply them.

Unlike other existing best practices list, we want it to be widely distributed to open source developers and community-sourced. And we want these practices to stick, thanks to an effective learning platform.



Our mission is to Identify, Evaluate, Improve, Develop & Ease Deployment of universally-accessible, developer focused tooling to help the open source community secure their code.  This space allows members to collaborate together on these goals.

* Identify - There are a large number of tools that developers can utilize in various development environments.  We need to ensure we understand the options available.
* Evaluate - Some tools are better than others.  We need to ensure quality tools are available to the open source community.
* Improve - Some tools need just a little bit of help to offer the best solution.  We need to, where possible, contribute to improve those tools.
* Develop - Despite the large number of tools available, there are still large areas of the security problem space that do not have tools to help developers find issues.  We will develop those tools where there is interest and bandwidth.
* Ease Deployment - __Most critically__, open source developers need to know what tools they should be using and how to easily integrate them into their development process.  Unless developers have an easy way to drop in security tooling, it is unlikely to be included.  We will provide this information to open source developers.



The objective of the Supply Chain Integrity Working Group (WG) is to provide a global community for collaborating to help individuals and organizations assess and improve the security of end-to-end supply chains for open source software.







Our objective is to enable stakeholders to have informed confidence in the
security of open source projects. This includes identifying threats to the
open source ecosystem and recommending practical mitigations. We will also
identify a set of key metrics and build tooling to communicate those metrics
to stakeholders, enabling a better understanding of the security posture of
individual open source software components.



* Enable faster cross-pollination of existing ideas across ecosystems (including technical measures, infrastructure approaches, and policies)
* Act as a clearinghouse for new ideas that could benefit multiple ecosystems
* Enable maintainers to better align and coordinate policies and changes between different ecosystems
* Identify & escalate needs for infrastructure and assistance for shared tooling and/or services (to be filled by supportive or sponsoring organizations (such as the [OpenSSF](https://www.openssf.org/)))
* Develop methods for sharing data related to software repositories, software registries, and tools which rely on them
* Delegate solving particular problems and goals to subgroups or other workgroups as appropriate

The working group may create:

* Normative, non-binding recommendations on common schemas
* Descriptive documentation of experiences and best practices

## Vision



The End Users Working Group (WG) represents the interests of public and private sector organizations that primarily consume open source rather than produce it.

We strive to:

- Ensure that the use cases for end user consumption of open-source software are understood and factored into OSSF programs.
- Provide the resources required by end users to develop and implement more efficient and effective strategies, processes, tools, best practices and solutions that secure software supply-chains.
- Provide a forum for learning from the experience and insights of peers.
- Create an End Users Working Group, with representation from key private industry, public sectors, and multiple geographical regions.
- Establish end user representation and active participation in OpenSSF working groups and leadership, both in the TAC and the Governing Board.



Our vision is to make it easy for developers to adopt these best practices, thanks to:

- _Identifying_ good practices, requirements, and tools that help open source developers create and maintain more secure software
- Helping maintainers _Learn_ to write secure software
- Provide tools to help developers _Adopt_ these good practices into their daily work

<img align="top" src="https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/img/OpenSSF%20Dev%20Best%20Practices%20Projects%20Relations.png">



Our vision is to improve the perception of security in open source software.

# Governance

The [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md) outlines the scope and governance of our group activities.

This group is chaired by Josh Bressers (@joshbressers).











## Scope



Based on the objective, mission, and goals above, we look to deliver specific delivereables:

- _Ensure that the use cases for end user consumption of open-source software are understood and factored into OSSF programs._
  - Refine Personas document
  - Develop a high level architecture and threat model of an end user within the supply chain
  - Identify controls/checks of interest to end users when ingesting OSS / vendor software (OSSF Scorecard)
- _Provide the resources required by end users to develop and implement more efficient and effective strategies, processes, tools, best practices and solutions that secure software supply-chains_
  - Bring more end users and their perspectives into the End Users Working Group, ensuring representation from as many industries, sectors and geographical regions as possible
  - Contact list showing multiple Linux Foundation groups contacted, individual companies also contacted
  - Development of guides, whitepapers, and materials focused on strategies and solutions for better security in software supply chains, open source software, and targeted towards end users.
    - Phase 1: Identify which guides / material is missing from existing material
- _Provide a forum for learning from the experience and insights of peers_
  - Establish end user representation and active participation in OpenSSF leadership, both TAC and the Governing Board_
  - Create matrix to show representation within working groups
    - Identify sub-team / focus areas
      - Recruitment
      - Marketing
      - Promote best practices and outreach



The Developer Best Practices group wants to help identify and curate an accessible [inventory](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/inventory.md) of best practices

- Prioritized according to ROI for open source developers
- Categorized per technology, language, framework
- Community-curated

Help build a community

- Program to attract open source contributors and incentivize them to use and contribute to the inventory

Supply a Learning platform
-Any free course can be integrated into the platform

- The learner can follow a track, track their progress and get badges
- A suite of exercises are available for each best practice of the inventory











The scope of this working group includes "security", as opposed to privacy,
resiliency, or other related areas. We also consider the broad open source
ecosystem, as opposed to focusing exclusively on critical open source projects.
