Welcome to the OpenSSF Community! 

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the OpenSSF community - improving docs, improving code, giving talks etc.

 ## Governance
 
To learn more about the project structure and organization, please refer to [OpenSSF Charter](https://openssf.org/about/charter/). 

OpenSSF has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

- The [Governing Board](https://openssf.org/about/board/) (GB) oversees the budget and legal status/structure of the OpenSSF. 
  - The GB conisists of one representative of each premier members, one elected general mmeber, one TAC representative member, one Associate Member Representative appointed by the OpenSSF Governing Board, and one Security Community Individual Representative elected by contributors to Technical Initiatives.
  - Subcommittees under the GB are open to all GB members or assigned representatives.  

- The [Technical Advisory Council](https://openssf.org/about/tac/) is responsible for the general success of all Technical Initiatives (defined below). TAC meetings are generally open to the public, with the exception of special sessions. 
  - TAC membership is limited to seven (7) seats, with alternating elections every year. Contributors to Technical Initiatves may run, and each contributor may vote in TAC elections. 
 

- Each **Technical Initiatives** (both Projects and Working Groups) is governed by its own Charter, which is approved by the TAC. Changes to a Charter must be approved first according to that Charter's terms and then by the TAC.
  - All Technical Initiatives are persistent open groups focused on a technical objective, with transparent proceedings that are open to the public, and vary in their objectives.
  
- Working Groups are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project.  Each working group has multiple projects and initiatives to explore. These are generally non-software focused. 

- A **Working Group** (WG) is also a persistent and open group focused on a particular aspect of the overall mission of the OpenSSF. Working Groups generally do not produce open source software as a primary artifact, though they often include some open source code, or even use licensed software, in fulfilment of their Charter. Each WG are open to anyone,  you donâ€™t have to belong to specific organizations to start contributing simply follow the (OpenSSF Code of Conduct)[https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct].
  - WG's may be bounded in scope -- for example, their charter may specify that the WG will wrap up after a specific event, such as a publication.
  - WG's may also be unbounded in scope -- for instance, where an effort is expected to be ongoing in support of open source security indefinitely.

- A **Special Interest Groups** (SIGs) is formed to address issues inside a Working Group. SIGs report back to the working group they are under.

- A **Project** is a persistent and open group focused on the creation and ongoing support of open source licensed software (source code) and its supporting artifacts (documentation, etc). Projects usually manage one or more GitHub repos of their own, may have separate meetings, etc.

## Communicating

Most communications happen in the following locations:
- On the [OpenSSF Slack](https://slack.openssf.org/) instance
- On one of the [OpenSSF Mailing Lists](https://lists.openssf.org/g/main/subgroups)
- On regularly scheduled Zoom meetings, which you can find on our [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

Most official meetings are public, and recordings are uploaded to the [OpenSSF YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUdhiXNEBEayowJXY_v7AXQ/)
