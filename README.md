 ## Governance
 
To learn more about the project structure and organization, please refer to [OpenSSF Charter](https://openssf.org/about/charter/). 

OpenSSF has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

- The [Governing Board](https://openssf.org/about/board/) manges the OpenSSF.  The GB conisists of one representative of each premier members, one elected general mmeber, one TAC representative member, one Associate Member Representative appointed by the OpenSSF Governing Board, and one Security Community Individual Representative elected by contributors to Technical Initiatives.
Subcommittees under the GB are open to all GB members or assigned representatives.  

- The [Technical Advisory Council ](https://openssf.org/about/tac/) structures and facilitates collaboration among the Technical Initiatives. 
 
- Working Groups are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project. OpenSSF Working Groups are open to anyone – you don’t have to belong to specific organizations to start contributing simply follow the (OpenSSF Code of Conduct)[https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct]. Each working group has multiple projects and initiatives to explore. These are generally non-software focused. 

- Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are groups that are formed to address issues inside a Working Group. SIGs report back to the working group they are under.

- Projects are software focused groups that are formed to address issues inside a Working Group. Projects report back to the working group they are under.
