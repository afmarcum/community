## OpenSSF Projects sorted by Work Group
### Securing Critical Projects Work Group
#### Allstar 
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ossf/community/assets/51727488/bc8deed2-6544-4a84-a603-3e9b0f83d595" width="250"  alt="image">

Allstar is a GitHub App that continuously monitors GitHub organizations or repositories for adherence to security best practices. If Allstar detects a security policy violation, it creates an issue to alert the repository or organization owner. For some security policies, Allstar can also automatically change the project setting that caused the violation, reverting it to the expected state.

Allstarâ€™s goal is to give you finely tuned control over the files and settings that affect the security of your projects. You can choose which security policies to monitor at both the organization and repository level, and how to handle policy violations. You can also develop or contribute new policies.

Currently, Allstar meets as part of the Scorecard meetings

#### Criticality Score

A project's criticality score defines the influence and importance of a project. It is a number between 0 (least-critical) and 1 (most-critical). It is based on the following algorithm by Rob Pike:

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/ossf/community/assets/51727488/7c6b5199-7896-4f72-972b-9d116ff39fa5" width="359" height="96" alt="image">

We have the Goals
- Generate a criticality score for every open source project.
- Create a list of critical projects that the open source community depends on.
- Use this data to proactively improve the security posture of these critical projects.



Currently, Criticality Score meets as part of the Securing Critical Projects Work Group. Join us every other Thursday.

<br clear="all"/>


#### Package Analysis / Feeds

The Package Analysis project analyses the capabilities of packages available on open source repositories. The project looks for behaviors that indicate malicious software: 

- What files do they access? 
- What addresses do they connect to? 
- What commands do they run? 

The project also tracks changes in how packages behave over time, to identify when previously safe software begins acting suspiciously. 

This effort is meant to improve the security of open source software by detecting malicious behavior, informing consumers selecting packages, and providing researchers with data about the ecosystem. 

This code is designed to work with the
[Package Feeds](https://github.com/ossf/package-feeds) project,
and originally started there.

If you want to get involved or have ideas you'd like to chat about, we discuss this project in the OSSF Securing Critical Projects Working Group meetings.

### Best Practices Work Group
#### Best Practices Badge
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ossf/community/assets/51727488/1494160e-5e34-41e9-8158-b1b47f8842f7" width="300" alt="image">

We help identify the best practices for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) and implement a badging system for those best practices. The "BadgeApp" badging system is a simple web application that lets projects self-certify that they meet the criteria and show a badge. The real goal of this project is to encourage projects to apply best practices, and to help users determine which FLOSS projects do so. We believe that FLOSS projects that implement best practices are more likely to produce better software, including more secure software.

See the [OpenSSF Best Practices badge website]([url](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en)) if you want to try to get a badge.

Currently, we are not meeting but join us on the slack channel [#wg_best_practices_ossdev](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C01AHCRP8BT) to participate in the conversation!

#### OpenSSF Scorecard

**HELP WANTED**

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/ossf/community/assets/51727488/a8609d21-1d6a-4f13-b126-c168e990ccea" width="200" alt="image">

We created OpenSSF Scorecard to help open source maintainers improve their security best practices and to help open source consumers judge whether their dependencies are safe.

OpenSSF Scorecard is an automated tool that assesses a number of essential heuristics ("checks") associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0-10. You can use these scores to understand specific areas to improve in order to strengthen the security posture of your project. You can also assess the risks that dependencies introduce and make informed decisions about accepting these risks, evaluating alternative solutions, or working with the maintainers to make improvements.

Currently, we are meeting at many convenient times; Check the [OpenSSF Google Calander](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) for a time that fits your needs.

### Security Tooling Work Group
#### Fuzz Introspector	
Fuzz introspector is a tool to help fuzzer developers to get an understanding of their fuzzerâ€™s performance and identify any potential blockers. Fuzz introspector aggregates the fuzzersâ€™ functional data like coverage, hit frequency, entry points, etc to give the developer a birds eye view of their fuzzer. This helps with identifying fuzz bottlenecks and blockers and eventually helps in developing better fuzzers.

Fuzz-introspector aims to improve fuzzing experience of a project by guiding on whether you should:
- introduce new fuzzers to a fuzz harness
- modify existing fuzzers to improve the quality of your harness.
  
We meet monthly on the first Tuesday, join in the conversation

### Supply Chain Integrity Work Group
#### GUAC

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/ossf/community/assets/51727488/c6aa7dc1-5d8a-4269-bb5b-2258ae473329" alt="image">

Software supply chain attacks are on the rise and itâ€™s hard to know what your software is at risk for and how to protect it. Many tools are available to help you generate Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), signed attestations, and vulnerability reports, but they stop there, leaving you to figure out how they all fit together.

[GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition)](https://guac.sh/) aims to fill in the gaps by ingesting software metadata, like SBOMs, and mapping out relationships between software. When you know how one piece of software affects another, youâ€™ll be able to fully understand your software security position and act as needed.

Currently, we have office hours and community meetings; Check the [OpenSSF Google Calander](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) for a time that fits your needs.

[gittuf](https://gittuf.dev/) provides a security layer for Git using some concepts introduced by [The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/). Among other features, gittuf handles key management for all developers on the repository, allows you to set permissions for repository branches, tags, files, etc., lets you use new cryptographic algorithms (SHA256, etc.), protects against other attacks Git is vulnerable to, and more â€” all while being backwards compatible with GitHub, GitLab, etc.

We meet on the first Friday of every month, or join us on the Slack channel [#gittuf](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C05QVUN4WUW) to talk.

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA ("salsa").

Itâ€™s a security framework, a checklist of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure. Itâ€™s how you get from "safe enough" to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain.

We would love to have you join our slack channel [#slsa-specification](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03NUSAPKC6)
Also, every week on Monday, we meet on Zoom; join us next week! Check the [OpenSSF Google Calander](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) for the invite.

### Securing Software Repositories Work Group
#### Repository Service for TUF	

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/ossf/community/assets/51727488/e2c9c29e-07e6-47e8-80c9-0e4ccdf4af24" width="350" alt="image">

[Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF)](https://github.com/repository-service-tuf/repository-service-tuf) is a collection of components that provide services for securing content downloads from tampering between the repository and the client (for example, by an on-path attacker).

RSTUF security properties are achieved by implementing The Update Framework (TUF) as a service.

Repository Service for TUF is platform, artifact, language, and process-flow agnostic.

RSTUF simplifies the adoption of TUF by removing the need to design a repository integration -- RSTUF encapsulates that design.

Repository Service for TUF (RSTUF) is designed to be integrated with existing content delivery solutions -- at the edge or in public/private clouds -- alongside current artifact production systems, such as build systems, including; Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI, etc. RSTUF protects downloading, installing, and updating content from arbitrary content repositories, such as a web server, JFrog Artifactory, GitHub packages, etc.


Our community meetings are Monthly on the first Wednesday.

### Identifying Security Threats Work Group (New Name: Metrics & Metadata)

The following projects are discussed at the work group level every other Wednesday. To join the meeting see the[OpenSSF Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

#### Security Insights Spec

This specification provides a mechanism for projects to report information about their security in a machine-processable way. It is formatted as a YAML file to make it easy to read and edit by humans.

Values that are included within the specification may be required or optional. Optional values are recommendations from the Open Source Security Foundation's _Identifying Security Threats Working Group_, but may not be prudent for all use cases.

Example implementations can be found on the specification's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec).

A collection of unofficial supplemental tooling can be found in the ["SI Tooling" GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ossf/si-tooling).

We are not seeking new members but improvement, suggestions and clarification requests can be logged as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/issues/new), raised as discussion on [Slack channel #security_insights](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C04BB493NET). 

To discuss live join the work group meeting. 

#### Security Metrics	

The purpose of this project is to collect, organize, and provide interesting security metrics for open source projects to stakeholders, including users.

This project is in early development and we welcome community support.
