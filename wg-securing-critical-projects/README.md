# WG Securing Critical Projects

This charter describes operations as an [OSSF Technical Initiative](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/master/charters/).
The [Focus](#focus) section below describes what is in and out of scope,
and [Governance](#governance) section describes how our operations are consistent with OSSF policies with links to more detailed documents.

### Objective

To the best of our efforts, the goals of the working group are:

1. Identify critical open source software (OSS) projects. 
2. Secure those projects.

## Current Work

* [Securing Critical Projects: List of Critical Open Source Projects, Components, and Frameworks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONZ4qeMq8xmeCHX03lIgIYE4MEXVfVL6oj05lbuXTDM/edit) - current version
    * Leads: Amir Montazery and Julia Ferraioli
    * Contributors: David Wheeler, Caleb Brown, Michael Scovetta, Georg Kunz
* [criticality_score](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score) - this attempts to estimate criticality using the algorithm described in ["Quantifying Criticality" by Rob Pike](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score/blob/main/Quantifying_criticality_algorithm.pdf); you can see the [Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25381397). A known challenge is that it emphasizes activity, and some critical projects aren't active.
